MANUAL FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYNTAX ERROR IN VIEWS.PY

The error message shows there's a syntax error at line 595 in views.py with "except Exception as e:" 
being invalid. This usually happens when there's no corresponding "try:" statement.

Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1. First, backup your file:
   cp hunt/views.py hunt/views.py.bak

2. Look at the area around line 595:
   grep -n -A3 -B3 "except Exception as e:" hunt/views.py | head -n 20

3. Check if there's a try statement before the except. If not, you need to add one.

4. Open the file in an editor:
   nano hunt/views.py

5. Navigate to around line 595 (the exact line with the error).

6. If you see an "except Exception as e:" without a preceding "try:" block, add the missing try block:
   - Add a line before the except statement with the same indentation level:
     try:
         pass  # Added missing try block
   - Make sure the indentation matches the except statement

7. If there are multiple "except" statements without proper try blocks, fix each one.

8. Save the file and exit the editor:
   - In nano: Press Ctrl+O (to write out), then Enter, then Ctrl+X (to exit)

9. Run the server again to check if the error is fixed:
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001

Alternative one-line fix with sed (if you're comfortable with command line):

This command will insert a try block before any except statement at line 595:
sed -i '595i\    try:\n        pass  # Added missing try block' hunt/views.py

If you need to restore the backup:
cp hunt/views.py.bak hunt/views.py

COMMON ISSUES TO LOOK FOR:

1. Missing try statement before an except
2. Indentation issues in try-except blocks
3. Unmatched parentheses or brackets that break the flow
4. Incomplete function definitions or missing colons
